Tehe reason this does not work is because you specified related_name='producer': related_name is the name of the relation in reverse, so it makes not much sense to name this producer. You can rename the relations to:

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    producer = models.ManyToManyField(Company, related_name='produced_products')
    importer = models.ManyToManyField(Company, related_name='imported_products')
then you can serialize the two relations with:

class CompanyRetrieveSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class ProductSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
        class Meta:
            model = Product
            fields = ('name',)
    
    produced_products = ProductSerializer(read_only=True, many=True)
    imported_products = ProductSerializer(read_only=True, many=True)
    
    class Meta:
        model = Company
        fields = '__all__'
