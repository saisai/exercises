Explanation
Intuition: Starting with the three examples, you will soon realize that this is essentially a Math problem.
Our goal is to see if left sum can equal to right sum, that is, left_sum - right_sum == 0.
To make it easier to understand, we can move digits to one side and ? mark to the other side, for example, ?3295???
Can be represented as ?329=5??? -> 3+2+9-5=???-? -> 9=??
Now, the original question becomes: Given 9=?? and Alice plays first, can we get this left & right not equal to each other?
The answer is NO. It doesn't matter what number x Alice gives, Bob only need to provide 9-x to make sure the left equals to right.
Let's try out some other examples, based on the previous observation.
8=??, can Alice win?
Yes, if Alice plays 9 first
9=???, can Alice win?
Yes, since Alice can play 1 time more than Bob
9=????, can Alice win?
Yes, if the sum of Alice's 2 plays is greater than 9
18=????, can Alice win?
No, ame as 9=??, doesn't matter what x Alice plays, Bob just need to play 9-x
18=??, can Alice win?
Yes, unless Alice & Bob both play 9 (not optimal play, against the game rule)
I think now you should get the idea of the game. Let's say, for left side & right side, we move the smaller sum to the other side of the equal sign (we call the result digit_sum); for question mark, we move it to the opposite direction (we call the result ?_count. After doing something Math, the only situation that Bob can win is that:
?_count % 2 == 0 and digit_sum == ?_count // 2 * 9. This basically saying that:
?_count has to be an even number
digit_sum is a multiple of 9
Half number of plays (or ?) * 9 equals to digit_sum
In the following implementation:
q_cnt_1: Question mark count for the 1st half of num
q_cnt_2: Question mark count for the 2nd half of num
s1: Sum of digits for the 1st half of num
s2: Sum of digits for the 2nd half of num
s_diff: Sum difference (we take the greater sum - the smaller sum)
q_diff: Question mark difference (opposite direction to the digit sum move)
Implementation

class S:

    def sumGame(self, num: str) -> bool:
        n = len(num)
        q_cnt_1 = s1 = 0
        for i in range(n//2): # get digit sum and question mark count for the first half of `num`
            if num[i] == '?':
                q_cnt_1 += 1
            else:
                s1 += int(num[i])
        q_cnt_2 = s2 = 0
        for i in range(n//2, n): # get digit sum and question mark count for the second half of `num`
            if num[i] == '?':
                q_cnt_2 += 1
            else:
                s2 += int(num[i])
        s_diff = s1 - s2 # calculate sum difference and question mark difference
        q_diff = q_cnt_2 - q_cnt_1
        return not (q_diff % 2 == 0 and q_diff // 2 * 9 == s_diff) # when Bob can't win, Alice wins


num = "5023"
print(S().sumGame(num))
