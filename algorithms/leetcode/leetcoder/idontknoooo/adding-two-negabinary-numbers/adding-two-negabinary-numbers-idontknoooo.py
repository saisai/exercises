Explanation
    Math fact for -2 based numbers
        1 + 1 = 0, carry -1
        -1 + 0 = 1, carry 1
        1 + 0 = 1, carry 0
        0 + 0 = 0, carry 0
        0 + 1 =1, carry 0
        -1 + 1 = 0, carry 0
        -1 + -1 is not possible
Based on above fact, we can do a two pointer addition from right to left
Remember to count the carry and remove the leading 0 before return the answer

Implementation

            elif (a == -1 and b == 0) or (a == 0 and b == -1):
                cur = carry = 1

                cur, carry = a+b, 0
            return cur, carry # Return current value and carry
        carry = 0

            if j >= 0:
                cur, carry_2 = add(cur, arr2[j])
            carry = carry_1 + carry_2
            ans.append(cur)
            i, j = i - 1, j - 1
        ans = [1, 1] + ans[::-1] if carry == -1 else ans[::-1] # Add [1, 1] if there is a carry -1 leftover
        for i, v in enumerate(ans): # Remove leading zero and return
            if v == 1:
                return ans[i:]
        else:
            return [0]

arr1 = [1,1,1,1,1]
