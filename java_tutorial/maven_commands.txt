mvn package


mvn spring-boot:run


mvn clean install 
is the command to do just that.

You are calling the mvn executable, which means you need Maven installed on your machine. (see How do you install Maven?)

You are using the clean command, which will delete all previously compiled Java .class files and resources (like .properties) in your project. Your build will start from a clean slate.

Install will then compile, test & package your Java project and even install/copy your built .jar/.war file into your local Maven repository. (see A look at the Maven build lifecycle: phases)


+ stocks-broker-app (parent)
    + stocks-data-module
    + stocks-rest-module (depends on stock-data)
    + stocks-ui-module (depends on stock-data)
	

cd ..  // so you are in the parent project
mvn -pl stocks-ui-module -am clean install  // or another appropriate goal

-pl lets you specify the submodules to build

-am stands for also make, which will build dependent modules as well

mvn -U clean install
