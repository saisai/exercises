# The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
# Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
# Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement,
# where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

# For each column, place a queen in each possible row that does not conflict with an existing queen.
# Time - O(n^2 * n!), n possible rows for first col, n-1 for second ... etc.  each result size n^2
# Space - O(n^2 * n!)


The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

Input: n = 4
Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: [["Q"]]


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 9
