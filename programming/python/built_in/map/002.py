'''
Weâ€™ve decided that all the aquarium creatures are in fact going to move into the same tank. We need to update our records to reflect that all of our creatures are moving into tank 42. To have map() access each dictionary and each key:value pair in the dictionaries, we construct a nested function:

'''

aquarium_creatures = [
    {"name": "sammy", "species": "shark", "tank number": 11, "type": "fish"},
    {"name": "ashley", "species": "crab", "tank number": 25, "type": "shellfish"},
    {"name": "jo", "species": "guppy", "tank number": 18, "type": "fish"},
    {"name": "jackie", "species": "lobster", "tank number": 21, "type": "shellfish"},
    {"name": "charlie", "species": "clownfish", "tank number": 12, "type": "fish"},
    {"name": "olly", "species": "green turtle", "tank number": 34, "type": "turtle"}
]

def assign_to_tank(creatures, new_tank_number):
    def apply(x):
        x["tank number"] = new_tank_number
        return x
    return map(apply, creatures)

assigned_tanks = assign_to_tank(aquarium_creatures, 42)

print(list(assigned_tanks))
